/************************************************** Router *****************************************************/

BrowserRouter
    BrowserRouter is a router implementation that uses the HTML5 history API /(pushState, replaceState and the popstate event) to keep your UI in sync with the URL.
    It is the parent component that is used to store all of the other components.

MemoryRouter
    MemoryRouter keeps the history of your “URL” in memory (does not read or write to the address bar).
    Useful in tests and non-browser environments like React Native.

HashRouter
    HashRouter uses client-side hash routing.
    It uses the hash portion of the URL (i.e. window.location.hash) to keep your UI in sync with the URL.
    hashType - slash, noslash, hashbang

Redirect
    <Route exact path="/">
        {loggedIn ? <Redirect to="/dashboard" /> : <PublicHomePage />}
    </Route>
