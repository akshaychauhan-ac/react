/************************************************** Lifecycle methods *****************************************************/

constructor
	constructors are only used for two purposes:
		Initializing local state by assigning an object to this.state
		Binding event handler methods to an instance
	If you don’t initialize state and you don’t bind methods, you don’t need to implement a constructor
	You should not call setState() in a constructor

componentDidMount
	invoked immediately after a component is mounted (inserted into the tree)
	if you need to load data or set up any subscriptions, use this method
	may call setState() immediately in componentDidMount().
		it will trigger an extra rendering, but it will happen before the browser updates the screen

componentDidUpdate
	invoked immediately after updating occurs
	not called for the initial render
	compare props and make calls

componentWillUnmount
	invoked immediately before a component is unmounted and destroyed
	perform any necessary cleanup in this method, such as 
		invalidating timers,
		canceling network requests, or
		cleaning up any subscriptions that were created in componentDidMount()
